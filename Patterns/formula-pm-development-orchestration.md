## Development Orchestration Workflows

### üöÄ Feature Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Execution)
1. **Database Agent** + **Backend Agent** work simultaneously
   - Database Agent: Schema design and migrations
   - Backend Agent: API structure and authentication
2. **Frontend Agent** creates UI mockups and component structure
3. **File Management Agent** (if needed): Designs upload architecture

#### Phase 2: Implementation (Coordinated Parallel)
1. **Backend Agent** completes API implementation
2. **Frontend Agent** builds components with mock data
3. **File Management Agent** implements upload systems
4. **Evaluator Agent** reviews each component (90+ score required)

#### Phase 3: Integration (Sequential)
1. **Integration Agent** connects all components
2. **Evaluator Agent** validates integration quality
3. **Failed components**: Re-delegated to specialist agents
4. **Final approval**: Production readiness check

### üéØ Quality Gates

#### Component-Level Quality (Per Agent)
- **Minimum Score**: 90/100 using evaluator template
- **Pattern Compliance**: Must use Formula PM conventions
- **Compilation**: Must pass TypeScript/build checks
- **Testing**: Component-level tests must pass

#### Integration-Level Quality
- **API Contract**: Frontend/backend compatibility verified
- **Performance**: Load testing and optimization
- **Security**: Authentication and validation verified
- **End-to-End**: User workflows tested and verified

## Coordination Protocols

### ü§ù Inter-Agent Communication

#### API Contract Definition
```typescript
// Shared between Backend and Frontend Agents
interface FeatureAPI {
  endpoints: APIEndpoint[];
  types: TypeDefinition[];
  errorHandling: ErrorPattern[];
  authentication: AuthRequirement[];
}
```

#### Component Interface Definition
```typescript
// Shared between Frontend and Integration Agents  
interface ComponentInterface {
  props: PropDefinition[];
  events: EventDefinition[];
  stateManagement: StatePattern[];
  dependencies: DependencyList[];
}
```

### üìã Handoff Protocols

#### Database ‚Üí Backend Handoff
- **Deliverable**: Schema files, type definitions, migration scripts
- **Validation**: Backend Agent validates schema matches API requirements
- **Success Criteria**: Backend can implement all required operations

#### Backend ‚Üí Frontend Handoff  
- **Deliverable**: API documentation, type definitions, authentication flow
- **Validation**: Frontend Agent validates API contracts meet UI requirements
- **Success Criteria**: Frontend can implement all user workflows

#### Component ‚Üí Integration Handoff
- **Deliverable**: All components, API integrations, test suites
- **Validation**: Integration Agent validates end-to-end functionality
- **Success Criteria**: Complete feature works in production environment

## Formula PM Specific Requirements

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Compliance
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: All routing must use app directory structure
- **Supabase**: Database operations through Supabase client
- **Shadcn/ui**: UI components must use established design system
- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety throughout

### üìÅ File Structure Compliance
```
/src/
  /app/              # Next.js 15 app router pages
  /components/       # Reusable UI components
  /lib/              # Utility functions and configurations
  /types/            # TypeScript type definitions
  /hooks/            # Custom React hooks
/supabase/
  /migrations/       # Database migrations
  /functions/        # Edge functions
```

### üé® Design System Compliance
- **Components**: Must use Shadcn/ui base components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Formula PM theme
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State**: Use appropriate state management (useState, Context, etc.)

### üîê Security Compliance
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **File Upload**: Secure file handling with type/size limits

## Agent Spawning Decision Matrix

### üîç When to Use Single Agent
- **Simple CRUD operations**: Backend Agent only
- **UI-only changes**: Frontend Agent only  
- **Database schema updates**: Database Agent only

### üé≠ When to Use Multiple Agents
- **New features with UI + API**: Frontend + Backend + Integration
- **Complex data operations**: Database + Backend + Integration
- **File handling features**: All agents (Database, Backend, Frontend, File Management, Integration)

### üèõÔ∏è When to Use Full Orchestration
- **Major feature additions**: All 6 agents
- **Architecture changes**: All agents with extra evaluator oversight
- **Production releases**: Full orchestration with comprehensive testing

## Success Metrics

### üìä Individual Agent Success
- **Quality Score**: ‚â•90/100 on evaluator template
- **Compilation**: Zero TypeScript/build errors
- **Pattern Compliance**: Uses Formula PM conventions exactly
- **Testing**: All component tests pass

### üéØ Integration Success  
- **End-to-End Tests**: All user workflows functional
- **Performance**: Meets Formula PM performance standards
- **Security**: Passes security audit checklist
- **Documentation**: Complete API and component documentation

### üöÄ Production Readiness

   - Follow Formula PM deployment procedures

### üìù Pattern Evolution
This orchestration pattern should be updated based on:
- **Agent Performance**: Refine roles based on success rates
- **Quality Outcomes**: Adjust standards based on production results  
- **Formula PM Evolution**: Update as architecture and patterns evolve
- **Team Feedback**: Incorporate learnings from development cycles
