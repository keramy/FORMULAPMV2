## 🔍 Pattern Validation Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing new features to ensure proper documentation:

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Check if similar pattern already exists
- [ ] Review existing patterns for integration points
- [ ] Identify required dependencies from previous waves
- [ ] Plan wave-based execution strategy

### During Implementation  
- [ ] Follow existing patterns exactly
- [ ] Use established component and API patterns
- [ ] Maintain role-based access control
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### After Implementation
- [ ] Create comprehensive pattern documentation
- [ ] Include code examples and usage guidelines
- [ ] Document integration points with existing features
- [ ] Update this coverage summary
- [ ] Verify 90+ quality score achievement

## 📝 Maintenance Guidelines

### Pattern Updates
1. **Version Pattern Files**: When making changes, update version in file header
2. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Update related patterns when dependencies change
3. **Quality Validation**: Re-run evaluations when patterns are modified
4. **Coverage Updates**: Always update this summary when adding new features

### New Feature Guidelines
1. **Check Existing Patterns**: Always review existing documentation first
2. **Extend vs Create**: Prefer extending existing patterns over creating new ones
3. **Integration Focus**: Ensure new features integrate with existing wave foundations
4. **Documentation First**: Create pattern documentation immediately after implementation

### Quality Assurance
1. **90+ Score Requirement**: All features must achieve 90+ evaluation score
2. **Pattern Compliance**: Must follow existing Formula PM patterns exactly
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify compatibility with all existing features
4. **Security Validation**: Ensure role-based access control is properly implemented
