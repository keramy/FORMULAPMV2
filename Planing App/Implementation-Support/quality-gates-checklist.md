# Quality Gates Checklist - Implementation Support
## Enhanced Coordinator Agent Implementation

### **🎯 OBJECTIVE**
Provide comprehensive quality gate checklists for each wave and system implementation, ensuring all components meet production standards before progressing to subsequent phases, maintaining high quality throughout Formula PM 2.0 development.

### **📋 QUALITY GATE OVERVIEW**

Quality gates are mandatory checkpoints that must be passed before:
- Moving to the next wave
- Deploying to production
- Marking a system as complete
- Integrating dependent systems
