## Priority Matrix

### Critical Priority (Must Have - Week 1-2)
1. **Project Setup & Infrastructure** - Enables all other development
2. **Authentication System** - Required for security and user access
3. **Basic Navigation** - Core user experience

### High Priority (Should Have - Week 3-6)
1. **Project Dashboard** - Primary user interface
2. **Task Management** - Core business functionality
3. **Multi-view System** - Key differentiator

### Medium Priority (Could Have - Week 7-12)
1. **Business Logic Implementation** - Advanced features
2. **Reports & Analytics** - Business intelligence
3. **Document Management** - Workflow automation

### Low Priority (Won't Have Initially - Week 13+)
1. **Client Portal** - External user access
2. **Mobile App** - Additional platform support
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Enhanced reporting

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Complex Role System**: 13 different user roles with granular permissions
   - *Mitigation*: Implement RBAC systematically, test each role thoroughly
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users updating same data
   - *Mitigation*: Use Supabase real-time with conflict resolution
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Complex dashboard on small screens
   - *Mitigation*: Mobile-first design approach, progressive enhancement

### Medium Risks
1. **Performance**: Large projects with many tasks
   - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, caching
2. **File Management**: Shop drawings and document uploads
   - *Mitigation*: Use Supabase Storage with CDN, implement compression
